            Customers want to be treated like human beings. For that to
            happen, they need to feel that they're being served by human
            beings. When finishing your About page, describe who you are as a
            person or a team, and what your personal values are. What's your
            company culture like? What bigger picture in life drives your
            business? Keep in mind a secondary audience of your company's
            About page consists of your future employees. This is another
            reason describing your personal values is a good idea â€” the key to
            your job candidates' hearts is to show them you have one too.
